# unconditional.bld - JMP (unconditional jump)
#
# Displacement size is structural (boundary):
#   short → 2 bytes (opcode + rel8)
#   near  → 5 bytes (opcode + rel32)
#
# Input: $disp_size (short or near), $offset or $target

structure Jmp

D output: M [output, sequential]

B disp: short | near
  short -> uses=arch/x86/opcodes, emit($jmp_rel8), emit($offset)
  near -> uses=arch/x86/opcodes, emit($jmp_rel32), reloc($target)

returns: output
