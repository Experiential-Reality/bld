# measure.bld - Unified measure structure
#
# One traversal reveals two aspects:
#   $_pos  = byte extent (what flowed out)
#   $_cost = B + D × L (what was visited)
#
# Size and Cost are not separate functions.
# They emerge together from traversal.

B partitions: N
D extent: M
L correlation: deps -> output

returns: output
